### Enroll list
Specify the classes in which you wish to enroll. The weekday keys should be
written in lowercase. The `location`, `program`, and `time` keys' values must
match the text in Wodify's calendar but are case-insensitive.

Note: Wodify Enroll assumes that the host machine is in the same timezone as
the desired classes.

```json
enroll_list.json

{
  "monday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "6:00 pm"
  },
  "tuesday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "6:00 pm"
  },
  "wednesday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "6:00 pm"
  },
  "thursday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "6:00 pm"
  },
  "friday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "6:00 pm"
  },
  "saturday": {
    "location": "redmond",
    "program": "sasquatch",
    "time": "9:00 am"
  }
}
```
### Running it on a Raspberry PI
In order to run this on a ARM based platform, a.k.a. Raspberry PI you might need to install the the chromium browser

```
sudo apt install chromium-browser chromium-codecs-ffmpeg
```

Additonally you'll need to update the <wodify_enroll.js> around line 165 to include the following:

````
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
          headless: true,
          executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser',
          args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
  });
````
Paying close attention to math the exceutablePath with the one on your system.
